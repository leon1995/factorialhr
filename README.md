authorizer = factorialhr.ApiKeyAuth('<api_key>')  # checkout other authorization methods
async with factorialhr.ApiClient(auth=authorizer) as api:
    all_employees = await factorialhr.EmployeesEndpoint(api).all()  # fetches all employees. on big companies you might want to increase the timeout by using timeout=...
```
Get a dictionary with team id as key and a list of member as value
```python
import asyncio

import factorialhr

authorizer = factorialhr.AccessTokenAuth('<access_token>')  # checkout other authorization methods
async with factorialhr.ApiClient(auth=authorizer) as api:
        employees_endpoint = factorialhr.EmployeesEndpoint(api)
        teams_endpoint = factorialhr.TeamsEndpoint(api)
        all_employees, all_teams = await asyncio.gather(employees_endpoint.all(), teams_endpoint.all())  # remember to increase the timeout if you have a lot of employees or teams
        employees_by_team_id = {team.id: [employee for employee in all_employees.data() if employee.id in team.employee_ids] for team in all_teams.data()}
```
