    t_endpoint = endpoints.TeamsEndpoint(api)
    all_employees = await e_endpoint.all()
    all_teams = await t_endpoint.all()
    employees_by_team_id: dict[int, models.Employee] = {team.id: [e for e in all_employees
                                                                  if e.id in team.employee_ids] for team in all_teams}
